          <p> My radical passion, responsibility, and need to fight alongside oppressed peoples seeking liberation and soveriegnty has allowed me to work in many difference fields in government, non-profits, and grassroots orgs. The needs for tech and for it be decolonized is a critical need I have identified and will be dedicated the rest of my career in. Coding, designing, and communicating in the current stage of our digital age are the weapons we must use to put an end to white supremacy.
            <br> <br> My journey begins with my ancestors. As a first generation U.S. American, born from Nicaraguan parents, I have been instilled with the responsibility to fight against the colonizer within me and fight for the native indigenous and black that make up who I am. 
            <br> <br> I joined the U.S. Army at 17 where I later deployed to Afghanistan. Since then, I have worked in different government organizations and have been part of many programs such as Teach for America, Americorps VISTA, and Public Allies. I've learned that our government is not what it needs to be and the nonprofit organizations that seek to fill gaps is not enough. I began to organize with organizations suchas the Dream Defenders that have fundamentally taught me and allowed me the space to understand the true power that each and everyone of us has to design a world that liberates. One thing is clear, as technology grows, we will not be able to do so if we don'tt begin to design with white supremacy at the center. With my expereince, my skills, and my passion, I have now dedicated my life to decolonzing tech, designing a world that centers soverignty and liberation, and communicating in ways that leads to organizing never seen before.
            <br> <br> I invite you to explore the projects that I have completed and the many projects that will come. Join me? </p>
